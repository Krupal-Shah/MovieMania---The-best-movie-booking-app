# MovieMania - The best Movie booking app

This is the first Python project I built. It was a cinema booking app which lets the user select the movie with the shows and timings and stores the information in the backend. 

It is made using Python3 and MySQL.

## Installation

* tkinter
* re
* pyautogui
* mysql.connnector

You can install them by running the following commands

pip install re
